            <h1>Formation and evolution</h1>
            <p>The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular
            cloud. This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars.[11] As is typical
            of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements
            fused by previous generations of stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the pre-solar
            nebula collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The centre, where most of the mass
            collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc.As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began
            to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU (30 billion km; 19 billion mi) and a hot,
            dense protostar at the centre. The planets formed by accretion from this disc, in which dust and gas
            gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed
            in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed or ejected, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and
            leftover minor bodies.</p>

            <h2>Inner Solar System</h2>
            <p>The inner Solar System is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt.[86] Composed mainly of
            silicates and metals,[87] the objects of the inner Solar System are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of this
            entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. This region is also within the frost
            line, which is a little less than 5 AU (750 million km; 460 million mi) from the Sun.
            The four terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.
            The four terrestrial or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, few or no moons, and no ring systems. They are
            composed largely of refractory minerals such as the silicates—which form their crusts and mantles—and metals such as
            iron and nickel which form their cores. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) have atmospheres
            substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and
            volcanoes. The term inner planet should not be confused with inferior planet, which designates those planets that are
            closer to the Sun than Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).</p>

            <h2>Outer Solar System</h2>
            <p> The outer region of the Solar System is home to the giant planets and their large moons. The centaurs and many
            short-period comets also orbit in this region. Due to their greater distance from the Sun, the solid objects in the
            outer Solar System contain a higher proportion of volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane than those of the inner
            Solar System because the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid.
            The four outer planets, also called giant planets or Jovian planets, collectively make up 99% of the mass known to orbit
            the Sun.[f] Jupiter and Saturn are together more than 400 times the mass of Earth and consist overwhelmingly of the
            gases hydrogen and helium, hence their designation as gas giants. Uranus and Neptune are far less massive—less than
            20 Earth masses (MEarth) each—and are composed primarily of ices. For these reasons, some astronomers suggest they
            belong in their own category, ice giants. All four giant planets have rings, although only Saturn's ring system is
            easily observed from Earth. The term superior planet designates planets outside Earth's orbit and thus includes both the
            outer planets and Mars.
